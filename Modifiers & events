Function Modifiers
Modifiers are code that can be run before and/or after a function call.
can be denoted by the modifier keyword

Modifiers can be used to:

  1) Restrict access
  2) Validate inputs
  3) Guard against reentrancy hack



Events
With Solidity Events, you can push data for the outside consumer from the blockchain, such as Web Frontend or Mobile Apps
Example: If we are building a decentralized exchange and if someone trade any token they can be notified in real-time through this event
So event handling is the two-step process
You need to declare the event at the smart contract level
The event can not be read from inside the Smart contract anyhow even in the future (Like way communication from the outside world)
Gas cost is lower than storage variable so you can take advantage of events in some places if you donâ€™t need to persist data.

When we emit the events the listener who is actually listing for this event on the frontend application will receive an update.

Indexed
The indexed keyword is basically used to create an index so basically suppose you want to filter out any specifics events then you can index that parameter
Adding an index will increase the gas cost because now Ethereum need to save the indexed data
A maximum of three indexed are allowed in a single event
