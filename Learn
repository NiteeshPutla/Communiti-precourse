How to cancel a transaction?

A:By replacing it with a self 0 ether transfer with the same nonce and higher gas(it only works only when the transaction is not included in the blockchain).


what are upgradable contracts?
A smart contract upgrade involves changing the business logic of a smart contract while preserving the contract's state.

What is a replay attack?
Replay attack is a fabrication attack where adversary resends already sent messages .

How to prevent replay attack?
1) a nonce that keeps track of how many transactions have been sent from the account. The rule is that miners will only execute transactions
from an account if the nonce is larger in value than a previous nonce. And only if it increments the largest seen nonce from that account by 1.
So it won't run a transaction if the new transaction nonce is 20 and the largest seen nonce from the miner of that account is 14. 
It needs to see 19 first, and recursively, 19 only runs when 18 has been run, and so on.

2) The second piece of information is the chain ID. If we don't specify the chain ID, then someone sending a transaction on the Ethereum mainnet-even
if the nonce is fine-can have their transaction re-sent on other chains.




what are flashbots?
Flashbots is a research and development organization working on mitigating the negative externalities of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) extraction 
techniques and avoiding the existential risks MEV could cause to stateful blockchains like Ethereum.
